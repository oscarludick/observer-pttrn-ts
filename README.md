# Observer Pattern

The observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state,all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Loose Coupling. When two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact, but have very little knowledge of each other.

The Observer Pattern provides an object design where subjects and observers are loosely coupled.
